# logistic_regression
Logistic regression with numpy dependency. 
Dependencies: - numpy
              - matplotlib
              - time
The following logitics regression implementation contains the following:
- vanilla gradient descent
- stochastic gradient descent 
- k-fold cross validation

The clf is trained on the titanic data set. It employs a vectorized approach. Functions that plots convergence curves have been commented out in fit().
